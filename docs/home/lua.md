# Lua Programming Language

> Lua is a lightweight, high-level, multi-paradigm programming language designed primarily for embedded use in applications.Lua is cross-platform, since the interpreter of compiled bytecode is written in ANSI C, and Lua has a relatively simple C API to embed it into applications.

## Modding with Lua

A lot of games use Lua as a modding API, it's a kinda fast language yet simple to use, and overall, very lightweight and for so it's very easy and cheap to implement it directly inside games and software.

Lua is used by Dansebox to provide mod support. This documentation assumes you already know at least a bit of lua, or a bit of programming in general, but don't worry because you can learn easily Lua without having prior knowledge on programming or Lua itself as it's not a hard language, you only need some determination ;)

At the moment of writting this, Dansebox uses `Lua 5.4` to work with mods.
